				Youth participatory action research (YPAR) offers great potential as a
				methodology for investigating and improving educational practices (Ca-
				hill 2007; Cammarota and Fine 2008; Fine et al. 2005; Kirshner 2007;
				McIntyre 2000; Morrell 2006; Torre 2009; Tuck 2009). Research in which
				young people are both the researchers and the focus of the study can pro-
				vide critical insider perspectives into how schools produce success or fail-
				ure. Young people are arguably the most important stakeholders of education
				inasmuch as their everyday school experiences provide a wealth of knowl-
				edge, ranging from the obvious to the subtlest interactions. This knowl-
				edge allows students and other stakeholders (teachers, families, and education
				researchers) to take action to improve various aspects of education, including
				teacher effectiveness, pedagogy, service learning, school counseling, school
				safety, student-teacher relationships, school climate, and student engage-
				ment, to name a few (Akom 2009; Berg, Coman, and Schensul 2009; Krueger
				2010; Ozer, Ritterman, and Wanis 2010; Smith, Davis, and Bhowmik 2010;
				Schensul and Berg 2004)
			</p>
			<p>
				However, rarely do adults listen to the recommendations and conclu-
				sions offered by youth who conduct their own original education-based
				research. Some have documented how adult audiences for YPAR projects
				often dismiss or challenge young people’s research findings on the basis
				that juveniles are supposedly too young to generate knowledge worthy of
				attention (Fine et al. 2005; Torre 2009). Those adults who dismiss YPAR
				findings fail to understand that effective educational change requires the
				voices and ideas of students. The most important voices, and unfortunately
				the ones most often missing in the dialogue, are surely those of students
				who represent possibly the best critical evaluators as a result of their daily
				and long-term exposure to schooling. Education is one of the only institu-
				tional processes in which those most affected by it have the least say in its
				design and function. When it comes to school, the opposite should be
				true. Those who have the most at stake should be empowered to take part
				and lead in decision making. The empowerment of students through re-
				search is the basis of YPAR, thereby bringing young people into the fold of
				evaluating, analyzing, and ultimately changing education to better meet
				their needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rodriguez and Brown (2009) state that YPAR has at least three important
				principles. The first is that YPAR projects should be situated in young
				people’s lives so that they can understand and address the problems nega-
				tively influencing their experiences. Situating the research in young people’s
				experiences allows for the opportunity to use findings and research products
				to engender qualitative improvements in their lives. In other words, YPAR
				projects should have a direct impact on young people by generating results
				that can change the institutions most responsible for youth policies and
				practices
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, YPAR projects are participatory in design, which involves tak-
				ing a collaborative approach to the production of knowledge. Knowledge
				emerges within a collective dialogue in which young people work together
				to design, implement, and analyze their research. Each step of the inquiry
				process therefore requires consistent dialogue about the purpose, objectives,
				and outcomes to generate questions that provoke discussion and emergent
				insights. Thus, the inquiry-based dialogue adopts a democratic character
				in that intellectual and creative works in projects are collectively shared
				endeavors
