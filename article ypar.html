			<p> Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) is a powerful methodology for investigating and transforming educational practices. It places young people at the center—not only as subjects of research but as active researchers themselves (Cammarota & Fine, 2008; Tuck, 2009). This positioning offers critical insider perspectives on how schools generate success and failure. Because students experience schooling firsthand on a daily basis, they possess deep, often underutilized knowledge about the educational system, including both overt practices and subtle interactions. By involving students in inquiry, stakeholders such as teachers, administrators, and policymakers gain access to a richer understanding of how to improve areas like pedagogy, school safety, teacher-student relationships, and student engagement. </p> <p> However, despite its potential, YPAR is often undervalued by adult audiences. Scholars have documented how youth-led research is frequently dismissed under the assumption that young people are not mature or credible enough to produce valid knowledge. This reflects a broader structural issue: education is one of the few systems where those most affected—students—are given the least voice in its governance. This contradiction undermines genuine reform efforts. Effective change requires listening to those who live through the realities of school every day. YPAR addresses this gap by empowering youth to not only share their experiences but also analyze and act upon them. </p> <p> Rodriguez and Brown (2009) outline three core principles of YPAR. First, the research must be grounded in young people’s lived experiences. The questions explored should emerge from real problems youth face in their communities or schools, ensuring that the research has meaningful, practical outcomes. The goal is not just academic insight, but tangible improvements in the institutions shaping youth lives. </p> <p> Second, YPAR emphasizes participation and collaboration. It is not about top-down knowledge delivery, but about co-creating understanding through collective inquiry. Students engage in every stage of the research process—from defining questions to analyzing data—through sustained dialogue. This democratic process positions students not as passive learners, but as knowledge producers, capable of generating transformative insights. </p> <p> In my view, YPAR represents a fundamental reimagining of who gets to speak, lead, and decide in education. It challenges the deficit narratives that paint youth as incapable or uninformed. Instead, it sees them as powerful agents of change. By embracing YPAR, schools can become spaces not just of learning, but of shared governance and collective transformation. True educational justice must begin by trusting young people with the authority to shape the systems that shape them. </p>
